Completed day 12 of the course
### Created a number guessing game.
#### Details:
in which a random number is picked by the computer which the user has to guess.
there are 2 difficulty modes: easy and hard.
if the user chooses hard mode, the user gets 5 attempts to guess the number.
if the user chooses easy mode, the user gets 10 attempts to guess the number.
#### What I achieved:
Tried to optimise the code and decrease the number of lines that i used.
The instructor used 56 lines while i used 31 lines. Hehe! :D
